Reproducible Computational Science - a Guideline
================================================


   More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. [\ `1 <https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970>`_\ ]


In the field of modeling and simulation, we can *and should* ensure reproducibility with a fully automated workflow [\ `2 <https://www.practicereproducibleresearch.org/core-chapters/2-assessment.html>`_\ ] from the input scripts to a finished document. This allows for external verification, greater trust in your results and comparative ease in reconstructing details of your own work in the future.

We would like to establish a working group within BAM that develops a wiki/handbook of possible approaches to tackle these challenges. 
Everyone should be able to access these documents and will be able to use these as a basis for future projects.
The competence center modeling and simulation will coordinate the efforts towards 
this goal, provide guidance and the infrastructure (e.g. a wiki, repositories). 
For completing the tasks itself, however, we mainly rely on the work of the interested participants.
